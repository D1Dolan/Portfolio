## Survey on Drinking Games:
The code for the final project can be found under the [INTR_Project.R file](https://github.com/D1Dolan/Portfolio/blob/main/INTR_Project.R). The data used for this project was collected in a survey I created, which is found under the [Peter-Dolan&Hyatt-Sbar.docx file](https://github.com/D1Dolan/Portfolio/blob/main/Peter-Dolan%26Hyatt-Sbar.docx). The data collected from this survey is in the [INTRProject_Responses.xlsx file](https://github.com/D1Dolan/Portfolio/blob/main/INTRProject_Responses.xlsx). This project aimed to examine what drinking games W&L students prefer and which are most popular. 

## Boxing Statistics Project:
Consists of the following files. [fighters.csv](https://github.com/D1Dolan/Portfolio/blob/main/fighters.csv) is the data set we used. [BoxingProject_INTR_Project2.pdf](https://github.com/D1Dolan/Portfolio/blob/main/BoxingProject_INTR_Project2.pdf) is the completed project that looks into the win rate for boxers based on the knock-out rate and stance. Most of the statistics for this project were done in R under the [INTR_Project2.R file](https://github.com/D1Dolan/Portfolio/blob/main/INTR_Project2.R).

## SQL CVS Pharmacy Database
This project is slightly different then my others. The aim here was to create a database that pharmacy stores like CVS could use in practice. All the work done for this project was in SQL, however, I no longer have access to the source code. In the file [P1_Team_2.pdf](https://github.com/D1Dolan/Portfolio/blob/main/P1_Team_2.pdf) you can see the completed project. [data_dict_315.xlsx](https://github.com/D1Dolan/Portfolio/blob/main/data_dict_315.xlsx) shows a table of the data dictionary with terms that can be used to query the database and their key type. Because I don't have the original source code, I have added a file [queries.sql](https://github.com/D1Dolan/Portfolio/blob/main/queries.sql) that contains the types of queries that work on this database.
